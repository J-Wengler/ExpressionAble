Welcome to ShapeShifter's documentation!
========================================
The official repository for the shapeshifter Python module, which allows for:

- Transforming tabular data sets from one format to another.
- Querying large data sets to filter out useful data.
- Selecting additional columns/features to include in the resulting data set.
- Merging data sets of various formats into a single file.
- Gzipping resulting data sets, as well as the ability to read gzipped files.
- Click `here <https://github.com/srp33/ShapeShifter-CLI>`_ for information on the shapeshifter command-line tool, which combines the features of shapeshifter with the ease and speed of the command-line!
